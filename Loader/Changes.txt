Hi Richard,

What an interesting piece of code! I've not done C# before, but I do have experience with many other languages.
    Various assemblers, BASIC, Pascal, C, VB, VBA, Perl, Powershell and Python.



Missing Shop Names:
    I have been through the missing shop names list and updated and added as many entries as I could by tracking them down in the XML files.
        Updated:     4
        Added:      85
        Unresolved: 22

    Of those that remain unresolved, I believe the following may require reference to the contents of the 'layer0.xml' file. These are generic shops that appear in multiple locations and all sell exactly the same items.
        BurritoBar
        Ellroys
        HotDogBar
        NoodleBar
        JuiceBar
        PizzaBar

    There are still 3 Shubin Mining Facilities on Microtech that need to be resolved.
        stanton_4_shubin_001    - Could be either SM0-10 or SM0-22 as they buy and sell identical items. Your choice.
        stanton_4_shubin_002    - Could be either SM0-10 or SM0-22 as they buy and sell identical items. Your choice.
        stanton_4_shubin_005    - Does not appear to exist outside of the XML files

    The 'CasabaOutlet_Food' entry may refer to sales of water in 'Casaba Outlet' stores.

    Not sure about the following but may also be referenced in 'layer0.xml' as they may have multiple locations:
        CargoOffice_Rentals
        RestStop_Bars

    The 'CryAstro_Crusader_01' entry could refer to 'Cry-Astro Service 042' on Crusader.

    The 'Survival' entry may refer to 'Medical' at Area 18.

    These enties seem to relate to items sold in either the Burrito Bar or Hot Dog Bar so not sure why they appear in this list of missing shop names:
        Burrito_Cart_Bottle_Water
        Burrito_Cart_Can_Fizzz_Soursop
        Burrito_Cart_Can_Fizzz_Peach
        Burrito_Cart_Can_Fizzz_Muscat
        HotDog_Cart_Bottle_Water
        HotDog_Cart_Can_Fizzz
        HotDog_Cart_Can_Fizzz_Berry
        HotDog_Cart_Can_Pips

    There are also two names on Microtech that should appear but do not:
        Outpost 54
        The Necropolis

    Sorry, I know they entries all show 01 Nov, but for the moment I have run out of time tracking down the unresolved shop names.



Shop Code Changes:
    I have also added a section of code to write out all the currently missing names into a timestamped file in the output folder.

    This is to make it stand out from the  other files and also so it could be easily kept for future reference.

    They are written to file in the order they are found.

    Example Name:
        missing_shops-20201030111708.log

Program Code Changes:
    I have left the debugger changes inserted by VSCode in the code.

    By writing so much to screen (at least on a PC), the code really slows down.

    I have added some stopwatches to determine how long each section takes. No other use was made of the PC while each of the examples were running.

    After running the third example test, I restored the code writes in the code files.

    If you wish to speed up the code, it might be worth writing the names of all the processed XML files etc. to a text file instead of the screen.

    I've added a timestamped 'mainlogfile' variable to Program.cs, but not implemented it as I have no idea how to. Sorry.



I hope you find this useful.
